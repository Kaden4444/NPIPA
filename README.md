# Network Performance Insights Platform for Africa
This project was created and is being worked on by 3 Computer Science students from the University of Cape Town. 
The web app is currently hosted at: https://npip.netlify.app/

## What NPIPA does:
The web application provides a user friendly representation of statistics from MLab's database on BigQuery. 
You are able to compare African countries connectivity data, view the top internet providers/regions and get a sense of
regional performance through a colourful map representation.
